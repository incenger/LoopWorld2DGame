## Introduction

We want to make a game where the character is **"Out of control"**, like the situation of the world right now. 
Each level of the game is split into several rooms, and the actions in one room can sometimes be recorded and then repeated in the next room. 
There are three type of actions: moving left and right, jumping and shooting to kill monsters. The goal of the player is simple, which is to find reward and avoid the monster on the way.
This is a sort of game where the only person you can blame is ... yourself.

## Unity version

This game is built with Unity version `2019.4.7f1`.

## Resource References

The original idea of the game belongs to the game **Time Lock** which was created by Marhshall Cannon for the Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam 2020.

The game uses free assets from Unity Store:
* Bayat Games
* Casual Game Sounds
* Mighty Heroes (Rogue)
* Too Cube Forest
